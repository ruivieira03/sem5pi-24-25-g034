# Glossary

This document includes the glossary with the terms important to the project's business.

This is a live document, so it'll be constantly updated in the middle of a *Sprint* and in between *Sprints*.

For the sake of organization , our group decided to sort the following list of  Terms by its  aggregate's prefixes:



**U:** User

**P:** Patient

**St:** Staff

**OR:** Operaiton Request

**OT:** Operation Type

**A:** Appointment

**SR:** Surgery Room 





**Note:** Each term without any prefix is assumed not be part of any aggregate and therefore be a **Service**.
