# US 5.1.8 - Patient Profile Registration for Healthcare Application

## 1. Context

As an Admin, I want to create a new patient profile, so that I can register their personal details and medical history.

## 2. Requirements

information, and medical history.
- A unique patient ID (Medical Record Number) is generated upon profile creation.
- The system validates that the patientâ€™s email and phone number are unique.
- The profile is stored securely in the system, and access is governed by role-based permissions


## Relevant Us Questions:

**Q:**  So, when the administrator starts creating the patient profile, what format(s) of the date of birth will they need to enter? Furthermore, what will be the format of the Medical Record Number generated after recording the data?


From a usability perspective, dates should be presented to the user using the operating system's locale definitions. since for this sprint you are building an API, you should use a standard format like ISO 8601.

medical record numbers are generated by the system following the format YYYYMMnnnnnn where YYYY and MM are the year and month of the registration and nnnnnn is a sequential numbe
