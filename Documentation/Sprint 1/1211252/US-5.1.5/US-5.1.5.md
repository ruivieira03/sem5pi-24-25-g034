# US 5.1.5 - Patient Account Deletion

## 1. Context

The healthcare application allows patients to delete their accounts and associated data, in compliance with GDPR regulations, which grants individuals the right to be forgotten. This feature ensures that patients can manage their data privacy and security effectively while maintaining necessary legal compliance regarding data retention and anonymization.

## 2. Requirements

Domain - As a Patient, I want to delete my account and all associated data to exercise my right to be forgotten according to GDPR guidelines.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Account Deletion Request: Patients can initiate the account deletion process through their profile settings.
- Confirmation Email: The system sends a confirmation email to the patient to verify the deletion request before proceeding.
- Data Deletion Timeline: Upon confirmation, all personal data is permanently deleted from the system within the legally required timeframe (e.g., 30 days).
- Deletion Notification: Patients are notified once the deletion process is complete, and the action is logged for GDPR compliance.
- Anonymization of Data: Some anonymized data may be retained for legal or research purposes, but all identifiable information is erased.

## 3. Analysis
