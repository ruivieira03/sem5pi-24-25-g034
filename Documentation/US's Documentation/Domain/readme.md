# US Domain - Domain Model

## 1. Context
*The domain model is a conceptual representation of the problem addressed by a system. In the domain model is supposed to describe the entities, their attributes and the relationship between them.*

## 2. Requirements

*Domain - As Project Manager, I want the team to elaborate a Domain Model using DDD.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Domain.1: The Domain Model must be represented using DDD (domain driven design).

- Domain.2: The Domain Model must be represented using UML (unified modeling language).

## 3. Analysis

#### Study
*The domain model is a result of understanding, analysing and idealizing the problem resolution. Using DDD (domain driven design) we can model the problem domain and get a set of priciples and patterns for building software systems.*

#### Analysis
*The domain model outlines/is aligned with the system design in a way that both facilitates its implementation and future understanding/maintenence for a new programmer.*

## 4. Design

Here we have our Domain Model for sprint A:

## 5. Implementation

The team ensured that the implementation/creation of the domain model aligned with the design specifications and notes given by the client.
As such we ensured that the vocabulary used it folowed as closely as possible the vocabulary given by them.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

To integrate this user story we used the puml coding language and the .svg image format.
